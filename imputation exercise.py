    # Pandas dataframes have a method called 'fillna(value)', such that you can
    # pass in a single value to replace any NAs in a dataframe or series. You
    # can call it like this:
    #     dataframe['column'] = dataframe['column'].fillna(value)
    #
    # Using the numpy.mean function, which calculates the mean of a numpy
    # array, impute any missing values in our Lahman baseball
    # data sets 'weight' column by setting them equal to the average weight.
    #
    # You can access the 'weight' colum in the baseball data frame by
    # calling baseball['weight']

    # YOUR CODE GOES HERE
